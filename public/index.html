  <h3><b>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</b></h3>
  <div>


  <p class='p1'>The Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering was started in the year 1987 with the idea of equipping young people with the necessary technical knowledge and professional skills needed to address the challenges in the rapidly growing field of Electronics and Communication Engineering and promoting research in this area. In the world of Smartphones, this department has a very significant role to play. Instigate an eye for detail inside the minds of youngsters and there is they come up with a lot of innovation in electronics. For this mission, the Department is fully equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories such as DSP, VLSI, Optical & Microwave, and RF/Communication.</p><div class="deptimages">

    <p class='p1'>The department of ECE, since its inception in the year 1986, has been at the forefront of imparting quality education to students. The outstanding achievements of our students in both national and international arena are the evidence of the quality of engineers produced by the department. The faculty members, state-of the art laboratories and continuous updating of curriculum and syllabi are helping us to perform better at the national level and produce globally competent graduates.
    </p>
    <p class='p1'>The Department has 15 laboratories, a separate Department Library, a Seminar Hall, adequate class rooms and other facilities. Laboratories are equipped with hardware, computers and software packages such as Matlab, Metrowind, OPTSIM, Xilinx ISE, Cadfeko, and Cadence. To conduct quality research and enable the students to learn experientially in Signal Processing and Embedded Systems, the department has collaborated with Texas Instruments, USA and established a Centre of Excellence (CoE). The students are encouraged to participate in co-curricular and extra-curricular events at the National level and they bring laurels to the institution.  The faculty members are encouraged to enhance their knowledge by attending Faculty Development programmes in premier institutions. They publish quality research work in reputed journals and international and national conferences.  Along with students, faculty members also files patents.
    </p>
    <p class='p1'>The Department is an Anna University recognized centre for pursuing research leading to PhD and MS.  The department has received various research grants from funding agencies such as AICTE (under MODROBS/RPS), UGC, ISRO, DRDO, etc.. The Curriculum is regularly upgraded to prepare industry ready graduates. Various teaching- learning methodologies such as active learning, project based learning, inter disciplinary projects have been implemented to improve the learning of our students.  Moreover, to encourage the self-learning, two of our labs are open for 24/7. These teaching methods not only improve their knowledge but also skills and attitude which will eventually help our students to pursue their career in research, employment in core industries and also be entrepreneurs. In a nutshell, the Institution and the Department are committed to produce employable and competent engineers for the 4th industrial revolution and serve the society and the engineering profession.
